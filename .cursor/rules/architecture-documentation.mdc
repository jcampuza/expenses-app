# Architecture Documentation Reference

When making code changes, implementing features, or making architectural decisions, always consult the documentation in the `docs/` folder for guidance and established patterns.

## Key Documentation Files

### Component Architecture

Reference [docs/component-architecture.md](mdc:docs/component-architecture.md) for:

- Component organization (UI vs application components)
- shadcn/ui usage patterns
- When to use `components/ui/` vs root `components/` folder
- Design system guidelines and best practices

### Loading Patterns

Reference [docs/loading-skeletons.md](mdc:docs/loading-skeletons.md) for:

- Implementing loading states with Suspense boundaries
- Creating appropriate skeleton components
- Query strategy for dynamic loading
- UX guidelines for loading experiences

## Guidelines

1. **Before implementing new components**: Check component architecture docs to determine proper placement and patterns
2. **Before adding loading states**: Follow the established skeleton and Suspense boundary patterns
3. **When extending UI components**: Follow shadcn/ui conventions and design system guidelines
4. **For new features**: Consider how they fit within the documented architecture patterns

## Documentation-First Approach

- Always check existing documentation before implementing new patterns
- Follow established conventions documented in the `docs/` folder
- When creating new patterns, consider if they should be documented for future reference
- Maintain consistency with documented architectural decisions
