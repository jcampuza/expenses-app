# Tooling and Package Manager

- Always use bun for running scripts and installing dependencies.
- Prefer these commands:
  - `bun run <script>` to run project scripts
  - `bun install` to install dependencies
  - Avoid `npm` and `yarn` commands.
- Do not create `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`.
- If a lockfile is needed, only `bun.lock` should exist.
- If you need to add dependencies, prefer `bun add <pkg>` (or `bun add -d <pkg>` for dev deps).
